# TASK:

Create a WPF Application OR a ASP.Net Web Application.
Your program should be a small student/course/grades viewer. The application should use the
data from the database server (login details below).
Your application should use ADO.NET, Entity Framework and LINQ to query the data from
the database. The application should be capable of doing the following tasks (you may use
more than one window/page if you want):
1. User should be able to search for a student by entering part of the name.
2. User can select a course from a list, and view all the students that took this course and
their grade.
3. User should be able to select a grade and show all the grades in the database equal to
or better than this grade, including the student that received the grade and the relevant
course.
4. User should be able to get a list of all the students who failed, and which courses they
have failed in.
5. Users should be able to manage studentsâ€™ participants in a course (i.e., add/remove
students from it). 
For all the tasks, proper information should be displayed (i.e. full student and course names
where appropriate, not only the IDs.)
